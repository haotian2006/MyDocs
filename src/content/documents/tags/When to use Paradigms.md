title: "When to use Paradigms"
---

Programming paradigms, like OOP and ECS, are a choice in designing a feature or system. Just because you didn't use/pay attention to paradigms when working on your project **_does not_** mean you are behind.

A common mistake for game developers is focusing on using paradigms the moment they find out about them _while_ they are in the middle of developing a feature or system. This slows down development considerably and can causes bad system design 9/10 times.

You have two choices:

-   (Recommended) Do not worry about paradigms until your next project, where you can focus more on system design/architecture without being punished for poor decisions
-   Ask for advice after you have a working version of the feature or system - asking if a paradigm would benefit what you are focusing on can help with refactoring
