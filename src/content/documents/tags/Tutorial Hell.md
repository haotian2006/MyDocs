title: "Tutorial Hell"
---

When you want to create something, instead of making an honest attempt you search for tutorials instead. This isn't just bad but also makes developing harder for you as you create more complex features in your journey.

The reality is there will not be a tutorial for everything, so learning how to break down features is what you should do as it will help you to plan/better understand what it is you are trying to make.

**Note**: As a last resort, beginners can safely rely on tutorials as a last resort
