title: "When to use AI"
---

Collaborative AI tools like the Roblox Assistant, ChatGPT and extensions of these can be safely relied on for solving smaller issues like coming up with a name for something, or for a list of game ideas that fit a certain topic.

As of 31st March 2024, almost all AI tools found on websites are not tools that **anyone** should rely on for real solutions. **Beginners** shouldn't because fake code can be generated, which isn't fun to debug for you or those helping you. **Non-beginners** should use it solely for the name/idea generation, or for generating a feature/system that you have made before (it's best to review something you know before blindly copying a potential hallucination).

### Side Notes

-   This does not apply to pathfinding, which does not affect how you code
-   Assistive code AI tools, like Tabnine and Copilot, suffer from the same problems. Always review solutions they provide before accepting them
