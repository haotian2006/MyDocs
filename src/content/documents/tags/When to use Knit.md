title: "When to use Knit"
---

Knit is **good** for people who are new to/unsure of project design, i.e organising features into folders

Knit is **bad** for people that:

-   Already know how to structure their own projects
-   Prefer their own, opinionated structure or
-   Are new to project design but have achieved **a lot** without it

**Note**: Knit will always be a learning experience, though it is **not** recommended if it will be bad for you as it will be too much to handle all at once.
