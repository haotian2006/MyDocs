title: "Factory Method"
---

Using classes with metatables ends up being problematic for several reasons:

-   No standard way to define a class
-   Lack of support due to complexity of metatables
-   **Lack of type-safety and autocomplete** (without bending over backwards)

Enter the factory method where you create functions that create and manipulate typed objects. This approach:

-   Doesn't impact support as you're working with dictionaries
-   Provides the type-safety and autocomplete you deserve
