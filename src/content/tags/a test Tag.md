If you are experiencing issues playing your animations, or are receiving the sanitised ID error, it's likely that you're running into problems regarding ownership. Here are your options:

**Set the animation's priority to Action or higher**
Animations at an equal/lower priority will not play over Roblox's default animations - Action is generally recommended.

**Upload the animation to your game's group**
If the game/animation is owned by a group, then both must be owned by the group.
