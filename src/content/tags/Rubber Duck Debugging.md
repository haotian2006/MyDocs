[Rubber duck debugging](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging>) is reading your code out loud, line by line, as if you were explaining it to somebody else. Very useful for super obvious problems.

It is an effective method to find solutions to/get a better understanding of the problems a developer faces, and should be the first thing they do when looking for solutions.
