Prefabrication is the idea of creating a template for something (i.e leaderstats) in studio. You can then clone it, make whatever changes necessary (i.e loading player data), then use it for whatever you need.

The benefits for doing this:
- Write way less code for the same/better results
- Don't need to be a scripter to change default values or the structure
- Easier to see how it currently looks and what changes were made
- [Improve performance by default](<https://devforum.roblox.com/t/psa-dont-use-instancenew-with-parent-argument/30296>)
