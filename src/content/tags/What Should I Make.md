The best way for beginners to find out their next project is to look at the games you play and/or [brainstorm](https://images.edrawmind.com/article/how-to-use-mind-mapping-to-design-a-game/how-to-design-a-game-mind-map.png) (write down a bunch of interesting ideas based on what you like, pick the most interesting then develop it).

The fastest way for the experienced is also to [brainstorm](https://images.edrawmind.com/article/how-to-use-mind-mapping-to-design-a-game/how-to-design-a-game-mind-map.png), but you can also Google lists of game dev ideas or make a certain feature for fun.
