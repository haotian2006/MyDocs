title: "Why External Editors"
---

**The benefits of using external editors over the Roblox Studio editor:**

-   Snippets (built-in) - type a few characters and generate commonly-used concepts or script templates
-   Symbol renaming (built-in) - easily rename a variable in a specific block/scope/everywhere
-   Workspaces (mostly built-in) - switch between games as easily as you would in studio, just double-click a workspace file
-   Extensions (support built-in) - custom file icons, AI-enhanced autocomplete, rename multiple files at once (super easy with above)

-   Rojo - sync changes from your folder to your Roblox place
-   Option to use TypeScript as a language alternative (only notable language alternative as of 22nd July 2022)
-   Use text files/extensions for taking notes/planning instead of multi-line comments stuffed in modules
-   External tooling - Moonwave (documentation generator), Wally/Foreman (Roblox package manager), etc.
-   Transparent windows - for appearance/utility's sake
