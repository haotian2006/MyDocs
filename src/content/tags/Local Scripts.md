title: "Local Scripts"
---

 
LocalScripts run code on a player's device. Compared to server scripts that normally have one agreed location (`ServerScriptService`), there are many locations that a local script can be placed for it to run:
- Inside a `Tool`
- Inside a UI instance (`TextButton`, `Frame`, etc) within `StarterGui`
- `StarterCharacterScripts` or `StarterPlayerScripts`
- `ReplicatedFirst`
