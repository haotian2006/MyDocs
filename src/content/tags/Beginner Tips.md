-   Try what you are being advised on, to avoid blindly accepting a solution that's incorrect
-   Try what you are taught, to gain a better understanding of what you are/will be using
-   Use whatever learning method (videos, documentations, experimentation, etc) works best for you regardless of other opinions - what works best for you will be the most efficient for you
-   There is no best solution for learning - outside of learning methods, you will need to spend time working on projects like everyone else
-   Do not compare yourself to others - use their creations as goals, not to reflect on yourself, because learning takes different amounts of time for everybody
